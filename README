--- CLONING ------------------
------------------------------

Tinyflock depends on an external repository called VLIQ which has been added as a submodule.

To clone VLIQ along with Tinyflock, either clone Tinyflock with the below command:

	git clone --recursive git://github.com/GenTiradentes/tinyflock.git

Or, simply run the following commands after checking out the repository as you normally would:

	git submodule init
	git submodule update

Failing to clone VLIQ will result in your compiler throwing a tantrum about not being able to find "VLIQ/vliq.h".

------------------------------
--- BUILDING -----------------
------------------------------

Tinyflock depends on GLFW, so make sure you have the required heades and libraries installed before building.
Using Debian, you can install the required package with the following command.

	apt-get install libglfw-dev

The default compiler specified in Tinyflock's Makefile is Clang. I find that with this project, it compiles faster,
and generates smaller, faster executables. However, your system may not have Clang installed, leading to the build
failing. To resolve this, install Clang or specify "CC=c99" after invoking make.

To build on most unix platforms, run

	make

To clean all the intermediate build files, run

	make clean

To clean the project, then rebuild it, run

	make rebuild

To see what arguments the application will accept, run

	./tinyflock --help

The demo is interactive using the mouse (left button to attract boids,
right to make them flee), as well as command line arguments, which are 
documented and viewable by running the program with the "-h" flag.
